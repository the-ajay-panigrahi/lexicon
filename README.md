## 💡 Why I Built This

I built Lexicon to address the common challenge of effective vocabulary acquisition. Traditional methods often lack engagement and retention strategies. My goal was to create an interactive and disciplined approach to learning new words daily, leveraging spaced repetition and gamification to transform a daunting task into a rewarding habit.

---

## 🧱 Challenges & Lessons

-   **Implementing Spaced Repetition:** Accurately building and integrating the spaced repetition algorithm to optimize review intervals based on user performance.
-   **Local Data Management:** Efficiently handling and persisting user progress, streaks, and word data using local storage without compromising performance.
-   **Gamification & UX:** Balancing the learning aspect with engaging gamified elements and an intuitive user experience to encourage daily interaction.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

-   The profound impact of spaced repetition on long-term memory retention for learning new information.
-   Best practices for managing and structuring client-side data persistence with local storage for offline-first applications.
-   How thoughtful UI/UX design, combined with subtle animations (Framer Motion), can significantly enhance user engagement and learning motivation.
